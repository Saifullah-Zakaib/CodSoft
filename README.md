# Internship Project

This repository contains three C++ tasks completed during my internship:

1. Random Game Generator
2. Simple Calculator
3. To-Do List Manager

Each task is described below along with instructions on how to run and use the code.

# Task 1: Random Game Generator

Task 1 is a random game generator.

# How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**: None.
2. **Instructions**:
   - To compile and run the random game generator, follow these steps:
     - Open a terminal or command prompt.
     - Navigate to the directory containing the code.
     - Compile the code using a C++ compiler, such as g++: `g++ random_game_generator.cpp -o random_game_generator`
     - Run the program: `./random_game_generator`
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to generate a random game.
   - The program will display the selected game.

## Task 2: Simple Calculator

Task 2 is a simple calculator application.

# How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**: None.
2. **Instructions**:
   - To compile and run the simple calculator, follow these steps:
     - Open a terminal or command prompt.
     - Navigate to the directory containing the code.
     - Compile the code using a C++ compiler, such as g++: `g++ simple_calculator.cpp -o simple_calculator`
     - Run the program: `./simple_calculator`
   - The calculator will prompt you for two numbers and an operation.
   - Enter the numbers and the desired operation, and the calculator will display the result.

## Task 3: To-Do List Manager

Task 3 is a console-based to-do list manager.

### How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**: None.
2. **Instructions**:
   - To compile and run the to-do list manager, follow these steps:
     - Open a terminal or command prompt.
     - Navigate to the directory containing the code.
     - Compile the code using a C++ compiler, such as g++: `g++ todo_list_manager.cpp -o todo_list_manager`
     - Run the program: `./todo_list_manager`
   - The to-do list manager provides options for adding, viewing, marking as completed, and removing tasks.
   - Follow the on-screen menu to interact with your to-do list.
